## Core React



1. ### What is React ?

    React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.
